# A bit of explanation is probably in order.  While OE/Yocto pins 
# things into a given user path when you run the OE init bash script
# and it does a bit of defaulting for this file.  This, unfortunately
# has the predictable need to blow out the config (which may have 
# extra layers in there that you now have to add back in...sigh...).
#
# This is actually un-needed.  Inside this .conf file, .bb file 
# metadata syntax and global bitbake variables apply.  ${TOPDIR}
# specifically refers to the directory in the structure within
# the directory structure that the bitbake command is issued in
# (i.e. build/) that is computed as fully qualified path name
# on the fly for any one given execution.  So, you can move this
# beast around.  You can pretty much, if you're using the oe_build
# manifest or like it, start building once you source the OE 
# init script at the toplevel of the whole build system.
#
# In the large, you'll be editing this block (the one you have
# after this BBLAYERS block should probably be left alone unless
# you know what you're doing and actually NEED to adjust this.)
# and you'll add lines in the same manner as below to add a 
# new metadata layer.
